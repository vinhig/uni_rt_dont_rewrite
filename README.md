Real-time path-tracer with switchable denoiser. It produced the results necessary to my master thesis "Real-Time Path-Tracing Denoising".

You can find the ![slides of my defense](Master_Thesis_Defense.pdf), the [thesis itself](https://dial.uclouvain.be/downloader/downloader_thesis.php?pid=thesis:40630&datastream=PDF_01&key=a8d4db3fe4108464af609b2dc7bfe794), the code, and some of the final result of the denoising here.
